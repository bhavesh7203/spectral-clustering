function [X, cost] = chapter6_solve (SDP, delta)

% SDP is as follows:
% SDP.R is the trace of X
% SDP.C is the cost matrix (n * n)
% SDP.Aeasy is a m_L * n * n array of matrices
% SDP.Beasy is m_L-length vector
% SDP.rho is m_L-length vector
% SDP.Ahard is a m_H * n * n array of matrices
% SDP.Bhard is a m_H length vector
% SDP.alphamin
% SDP.alphamax

% think about this later
epsilon = 1/2;

alphamin = SDP.alphamin;
alphamax = SDP.alphamax;

while (alphamax - alphamin > delta)
