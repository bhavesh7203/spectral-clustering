function [y] = cluster_from_psd (Gamma, cost_func)

% Takes Gamma(psd) with 1s on the diagonal and smaller absolute values
% elsewhere, and returns clustering based on repeated randomized
% projection. cost_func is used to choose the best randomized projection.

% then cluster the transformed points

% lets get into coordinates we like
y = y*2 - 3;
